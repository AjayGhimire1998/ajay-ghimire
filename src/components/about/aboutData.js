My dedication to hard work and quick learning abilities, combined with my positive attitude and problem-solving skills, earned me a promotion to Cook within just six months. This experience honed my ability to work effectively under pressure and in fast-paced environments.",

      "After leaving the restaurant at the end of 2022, I embarked on a new journey as a Retail Assistant in a pharmacy setting. This role has allowed me to further develop my communication and customer service skills, which are crucial in any industry. In my free time, I like to joke that I'm also a master at counting pills and sorting medication â€“ though I'll leave the actual prescriptions to the pharmacists.",
